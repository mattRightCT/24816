# 24816: A Flexible 2048
*[Play 24816 now](https://m2apps.co/)*

The 2048 mobile app has been occasionally updated to include more intrusive ads, but no new features had been added in years. After years of playing this game, I had a few ideas for new features, but wasn't getting anywhere with the mobile devs, so I decided to make my own version and release it as a web app.

## New Features
- Change the size of the board (can handle up to 20x20, though I wouldn't recommend going over 10x10, as the text gets increasingly hard to read)
- Change the frequency with which '4' blocks are added. Personally, I found the game much more strategically challenging with '4'-block set to 0%.
- Scores are tracked separately for each unique game setting to ensure accuracy.
- All past scores are saved, letting you track your progress over time
- Can 'Undo' more than one move. In fact, you can undo all the way back to the beginning of the game if you really wanted to.
- For really serious 2048 players, you can create your own board with the 'Board Editor' to practice how to tackle tricky situations.

## Roadmap
- Graph to plot scores over time and across settings
- Download all score data for players to perform their own custom analyses
